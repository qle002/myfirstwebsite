                    <!-- This is the updated description of what the college has helped me gain -->

                    <p><a href='https://www.plattsburgh.edu/'>SUNY Plattsburgh</a> has helped me gain the knowledge, experience and confidence needed for my major and for me to get ready in the work force of the future.
                    It also shows me who I am and who I am not through multiple successes and failures.
                    I learn that it is completely useless to try to be someone that you are not.
                    By trying to be like other people, you are holding your own strengths & interests back.
                    Moreover, it teaches me how to balance my workloads so that I don’t burnout. </p>

                    <p>The most important of all, however, is that the university has showed me how to create my own opportunities from nothing.
                    Jobs don’t fall on your lap; dreams don’t just happen. You must work for things, and make things happen the way you want it to be.
                    So, reach out, talk, and connect with people. And here are some of the courses that have helped me move closer to my goal: </p>
