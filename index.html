            <p>I am a computer science major and web designing minor. 
            My goal is to find an internship soon in order to further develop my skills, and gain experience that are required to succeed in my field of study.</p>

            <p>I was excited to learn about the junior developer position that your company is seeking and would greatly appreciate your consideration of my placement in this role. 
            I’ve closely reviewed the needs and requirements for the role and believe that my qualifications have prepared me to contribute great value to your organization.</p>

            <p>While in high school, I developed an interest in computer science, security and artificial intelligence. 
            I wanted to know what made a computer work and how to write code to build your program from the ground up. 
            However, I didn’t know if I was cut out to be a computer scientist. Due to this, I worked hard to hone my skills to become a better coder. 
            I am fortunate enough to be born into a generation that has instant access to the internet with just one click of a button, so my task was easier than those born into earlier generations.
            I am highly focused and attentive to details when addressing considerable task loads to meet with the deadlines. 
            Besides, I am inspired to make a positive impact by applying my skills, and my problem-solving abilities allow me to address challenges to achieve results.</p>
            
            <p>My academic experiences have served me well in developing my problem-solving, observation, and organization skills. 
            I work well to use clear and concise communication to interact professionally with co-workers and supervisors. 
            I look forward to speaking with you regarding my skill set and attributes which I believe will serve as an asset to support the company's goals. 
            Thank you for your precious time and I hope that you would take me into consideration for the role in mentioned.</p>
