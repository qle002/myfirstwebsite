                <p>In my free times, I like to listen to music, watch movies, or read books.
                One of my favorite books is <em>“Kafka on The Shore”</em> by <a href='http://www.harukimurakami.com/'>Haruki Murakami</a>.
                I sometimes use Photoshop to mess with my friends’ pictures and get a reaction out of them, which is always fun to do.
                I also play the guitar and am currently learning to play the violin, which is extremely hard; however, it is never too late to learn something new. </p>
